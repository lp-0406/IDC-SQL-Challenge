🚀 Day 1 – SQL Challenge | Powered by DPDzero

Starting my SQL journey strong! Today I explored the most fundamental SQL command: SELECT.

This command is the key to asking questions from your database and retrieving meaningful information.

💡 Key Learnings

SELECT helps extract data from tables.

SELECT * displays all columns — helpful, but not always efficient.

SELECT DISTINCT removes duplicates and returns unique values.

✅ Challenge

Retrieve all unique hospital services from the database using SELECT DISTINCT.

This simple command showed me how powerful and clear data retrieval can be when used smartly!

A big thanks to Indian Data Club and DPDzero for this learning experience!

🔥 Ready for Day 2!
