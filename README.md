# IDC-SQL-Challenge
# 🚀 21 Days SQL Challenge (Beginner → Advanced)

Hey! 👋  
I’ve officially joined the **21 Days SQL Challenge** organized by [**Indian Data Club (IDC)**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/indian-data-club/) and **DPDzero** 💪  

I’ll be documenting my **entire 21-day SQL learning journey** here — from absolute basics to advanced concepts like **CTEs, window functions, and subqueries**.  
The goal? Build strong SQL fundamentals and get *hands-on* with real-world problem-solving using the **Hospital Database** 🏥

## 🌟 Why I’m Doing This

I’ve always been fascinated by how data tells stories — and SQL is the language that helps us *ask the right questions.*  
This challenge is my commitment to:

- Strengthen my **data querying and analysis** skills 📊  
- Stay consistent with daily practice 💪  
- Learn the *why* behind every query, not just the *how*  
- Build a solid portfolio of SQL scripts right here on GitHub 💻
